# Curiosity - Project

All the target are generated by random / fixed locations - no changes

Looking for `p(s(ci, t))` . Need to save for each t:

* Prior - `p(s(ci,t))`  (p(s(ci,0) - initiates at union distribution - 0.5 for each ci at t=0)
* Posterior - `p(s(ci,t))`

`rij` - calculated by Euclidian distance (Pythagoras)



**Classes Description**

`main` - Running the simulation

`Area` - Contains the size of the area and the targets

`Agent` -  The sensor which try to detect where are the targets 

`Cell` - for each cell, includes the location and "is_target"

Need to generate data for in each seconds by Bernoulli distribution

* Target sends signals: `a(ci,t)`
* Agent receiving signal: `x(ci,t)`

Data - CSV with columns: (`t`, `cell_id`, `a`,  `x`,  `s` )                             Need to predict: `p(s(cell_id, t))`

`DataGenerator` - Writing events each t_interval - Pseudo Code:

​								**** Generating Targets ****

​								for tick in range(0, NUM_ROUNDS):

​									if tick % t_interval == 0:

​										for cell_id in range(0, N*N):

​											if target in cell_id exists:

​												a(cell_id, tick) = bernoulli_experiment(pta)

​											else:

​												a(cell_id, tick) = bernoulli_experiment(alpha * pta)

​											if a:

​												x(cell_id, tick) = e ** (-rij / lambda_agent)

​											else:

​												x(cell_id, tick) = 0											

Need to create the Bayesian updates

# Questions 

#### Bugs

* a - all is 1 (if target exists or not exists; if exists should be all 1, if not exists should be sum to ~0.5* total_zeros) - **V**
* if target (s) exists, the agent barely receive signal - **V**
* Should I update for each cell separately based on his value only?
* Parameters?
* Randomize of the cells are not producible. 
* Pretty Plot & graph
* Numpy array and not use pandas - (one run, not 2 - one for generating and one for updating), matrix.
